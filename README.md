## Five Day services

The Date and time at which data is collected is retrieved and stored within two values. These are the dt (delta time) and dt_txt (delta time text). These values are converted and compared through the dt_txt_format_checker method. Each value which is correct is considered true. The amount of times this happens is stored inside the variable true_values. As four values are tested, true_values is expected to be 4 if the data is correct.
