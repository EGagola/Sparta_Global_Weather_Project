# Sparta_Global_Weather_Project

### Before using any service:

This project requires a number of gems to be installed, which are included in the gemfile for convenience. Please run 'bundle' and they will be installed for you.

You will also need an API key, which should not be shared online, and has therefore been hidden. You can get an API key by creating an account at 'https://openweathermap.org/api'.

Following this, please create a file named '.env' in the main project directory. This file should include your api key, in the format "OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=000000000", where 000000000 is replaced with your API key.
